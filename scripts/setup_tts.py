"""Install Amika's voice, her Live2D model and the paper doll that stands in for her helpers (from Hugging Face) and
the OpenAmika voice server (a MekaHime build of GPT-SoVITS) that speaks with that voice.

    envs\\brain\\Scripts\\python.exe scripts\\setup_tts.py   # Windows, after scripts\\setup_windows.ps1 (any Python 3.11 works)
    python scripts/setup_tts.py --cpu                # no NVIDIA GPU: CPU torch (slow)
    python scripts/setup_tts.py --accept-voice-license   # unattended: accept her license up front
    python scripts/setup_tts.py --verify             # check everything file by file; download and install nothing
    python scripts/setup_tts.py --assets-only        # only her voice, her Live2D model and the paper doll, no voice server
    python scripts/setup_tts.py --from-dir <folder>  # her files from a local copy of the repository (offline)
    python scripts/setup_tts.py --self-test          # also start the server once and synthesize a line

First it shows her personal-use license in short and asks you to type yes (her voice, her Live2D model and the paper
doll share one license), so the rest can run unattended. Then:

1. Her voice, her Live2D model and the paper doll, from the Hugging Face repository MekaHime/MekaHime_Amika at pinned
   revisions, file by file with the standard library (no venv needed, so a failed torch install never costs her voice
   or her body). Every file is checked against its size and SHA-256 in scripts/MekaHime_Amika.manifest.json:
     vendor/tts-engine/Speakers/MekaHime_Amika/   her voice: character.json, MekaHime_Amika.ckpt (GPT weights),
                                                  MekaHime_Amika.pth (SoVITS weights), references/emotions.json and one
                                                  clip per emotion tag (69), the README and LICENSE of the repository
     avatar/models/Amika/                         her Live2D model (live2d/Amika in the repository), where the Use page
                                                  finds it; a banks.json edited on the Setup page is never overwritten
     avatar/models/Host/                          the paper doll (live2d/Host in the repository): MekaHime's folded-paper
                                                  shrine doll, which the Use page seats beside her while a task agent
                                                  (Hermes Agent, nanoMuse) is switched on; its banks.json says
                                                  "role": "agent". Pinned at its own revision (PAPER_DOLL_REV)
   The repository is public from OpenAmika's public release on; before that it needs a Hugging Face read token in
   HF_TOKEN (or a saved `hf auth login`). The token goes to huggingface.co only (never to the CDN it redirects to,
   nor to a mirror) and is never printed or saved. HF_ENDPOINT picks a mirror, as in huggingface_hub; every file is
   still checked against its pinned SHA-256.
2. The voice server in vendor/tts-engine/ (everything but main.py and the docs is git-ignored):
     .venv/          Python 3.11 venv (3.12 works, untested): torch + torchaudio 2.9.1 (cu128 / cpu) +
                     requirements-tts.txt
     GPT-SoVITS/     upstream RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS at a pinned commit (MIT), with its pretrained models (HuBERT,
                     RoBERTa, ERes2NetV2 speaker model, G2PW, fastText language ID) and the Japanese user dictionary
                     its front-end builds on first use
     nltk_data/      English POS tagger + CMUdict for the English front-end
     ffmpeg/         ffmpeg + ffprobe for Opus output (optional: WAV works without it)
3. Checks: the voice has a clip for every tag OpenAmika's voice adapter (speech/voice_adapter.py) can send, each Live2D
   model has every file its .model3.json names (the paper doll also its "role": "agent"), and settings.json starts
   this server (services.tts) with that voice (tts_character). settings.json is never edited.

Needs Python 3.11 or 3.12 (scipy, onnxruntime and matplotlib at the pinned versions have no wheels for 3.10, and
upstream's numpy<2 has none for 3.13); Linux with glibc 2.28 or newer; macOS 14 or newer on Apple Silicon.

Integrity: every model and data file, every file of her voice and Live2D model (at a pinned revision of her
repository) and the Windows ffmpeg build are checked against a size and SHA-256 pinned here or in the manifest; a
download that does not match fails at once instead of being retried. GPT-SoVITS is pinned by commit: git checks the
objects it fetches. Without git, the zip GitHub serves for that commit is checked before unpacking against a pinned
SHA-256 over all 282 of its files (see tree_digest), and the unpacked GPT_SoVITS/TTS_infer_pack/TTS.py against its
own pinned SHA-256, again on every re-run (for a git checkout too). The Linux ffmpeg build comes from a rolling
release and is checked against the SHA-256 GitHub lists for that file, and Python packages come from PyPI / the
PyTorch index at pinned versions. Downloads resume from .part files. Re-running skips what is already present and
verified (hashes are cached by size and modification time), so it is also the repair: a failed step is reported, the
steps that do not depend on it still run, the summary at the end lists every step (OK, -- skipped or optional, !!
failed, each with its fix) and the exit code is 1 if any failed (130 after Ctrl-C).
Only the standard library is used here; packages are installed into the venv this script creates.
