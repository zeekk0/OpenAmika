"""OpenAmika tools layer — MCP client + capability block + post-speech clerk + agent job relay.

Design (docs/TOOLS.md):
  * Users register MCP servers (stdio command or streamable-HTTP URL) in config/tools.json,
    editable from the UI "Tools" page. Discovery runs over the official `mcp` SDK. Personal
    task agents (Hermes Agent, nanoMuse) come in through servers/openamika-agents, which exposes
    every agent as the same four tools: ask / status / answer / stop.
  * She decides, the clerk transcribes. Every enabled server is described to her, in character,
    in a [你手边的工具] block inside both the surface and the deep prompt (capability_block). She
    answers exactly as she always does — agreeing, refusing, stalling. Nothing runs before she has
    spoken.
  * After the turn's text is final, a small metered "clerk" call (after_turn → phase "tools", on
    the configured clerk_role model) reads what the user asked and what she said out loud, and
    outputs only the calls she committed to. Each call must quote the user's own words that
    constitute the request; the quote is verified against the user's text in code, so neither
    she nor the clerk can start anything the user did not ask for this turn. Proactive turns
    (idle reflection, injected cues) never run the clerk.
  * Agent jobs run in the bridge; a poller relays their progress, questions, approval requests
    and the final report back through her (an injected turn, "personality relay"). An agent's
    approval request is released only by the user's words on a later turn (clerk, quote-verified)
    or by a click on the Use page ("Her helpers") — she has no approve path of her own.
  * Per-tool policy for plain MCP servers: "auto" executes, "deny" hides the tool from the clerk,
    "confirm" parks the call as PENDING for the Use page. Agent bridge tools are auto by design:
    their consent lives in the quote check.
  * Health: every agent bridge has a `health` tool (is the agent process up, is the key accepted?).
    A background thread probes it every _HEALTH_TTL seconds; the result shows on the Tools page, goes
    into her capability block ("联系不上") so she does not promise what cannot run, and is re-checked
    right before every `ask` — an ask to an unreachable agent is not sent, she tells the user instead.
  * Autostart: an agent server may carry `autostart` (its own start command). When the probe finds the
    agent unreachable, the brain launches that command detached (so it outlives the brain), reports
    "starting" for a grace period, and gives up after a few attempts (Start button on the Tools page
    resets the budget). The clerk waits a moment for a just-launched agent before giving up on an ask.
    Its paths may use %VARIABLES% and be relative to the OpenAmika folder (launch_path, as in launch.py).
  * Open turns (she speaks on her own after his request, e.g. "fine, having Hermes look it up"): the
    clerk runs with the user's most recent message as the only quote source, at most once per message,
    and never takes approvals/answers from such a turn (webui._tools_after_turn decides when).
  * A result reaches her two ways at once: as an injected turn (spoken at the first quiet moment) and, until
    she has told him, as a "刚送到" entry in her capability block — so a user turn that comes first already
    knows it. The clerk reports which results she conveyed (`told`); a relay she no longer needs is dropped.
  * Delivery is durable: a relay becomes an injected turn, but the speech gateway drops a proactive turn
    when the user talks over it (it is then pruned from history as never spoken). The poller watches each
    relay turn and queues the note again when the turn vanished unspoken (_check_deliveries).
  * Honesty guard: the clerk also flags a concrete result she attributed to a helper that has not reported
    one ("fabricated"); the brain tells her at once to take it back, and a late real result tells her to
    correct herself.
  * IoT needs the accepted IoT safety statement (docs/IOT_DISCLAIMER.md; version and rules in
    iot_disclaimer.py). A smart-home server (the openamika-iot bridge, Home Assistant's MCP server, any
    "kind": "iot") is never started or connected before the current version was accepted on the Tools
    page: the hub refuses it on every path, a config that switches one on is refused (409), and a new
    version holds IoT off again until it is accepted.
  * Everything here is fail-quiet: a broken config, a dead MCP server or a missing `mcp`
    package must never break a conversation turn.
